Never be bothered by caps lock

As is known, `capslock` is almost useless in vim's normal mode.
If it happens that the capslock is locked, you know what the fuck
is going to happen:
+   You want to move up, but came out a `man`;
+   You wanna move down, but line joins;
+   You try to undo those joins, but it undo itself;
+   ...
So lots of vimmers disabled the capslock or map it to another key.
Yes, that is a beautiful solution. I don't like capslock too.
But someday, I notice that the capslock is still useful,
---if you have to use an on screen keyboard (e.g., with a touch screen)
Then I decide to do a simple thing instead of remap the keyboard:
Toggle off the capslock when back to normal mode,
---that is what this plugin do.

`vimcaps` now only support windows, linux support will be added later.
Since I don't have a mac, there won't be any mac support until someone
send a pull request. :)
